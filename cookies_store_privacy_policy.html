    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 9, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using the <strong>Cookies Store</strong> Chrome Extension. Your privacy is important to us.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information or browsing data. The extension operates entirely on the user's browser and does not transmit or save any private information.</p>

    <h2>2. Cookie Usage</h2>
    <p>The extension fetches publicly accessible cookie data from a remote server based on the domain you are currently visiting. These cookies are imported into your browser only upon your request, and are not stored or analyzed by us.</p>

    <h2>3. Remote Requests</h2>
    <p>To provide its core functionality, the extension sends a request to a remote API (e.g., <code>https://example.com/cookie_store/api.php</code>) to retrieve domain-specific cookie data. No personal or sensitive user data is included in these requests.</p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requires browser permissions to access tabs, cookies, and active websites to operate correctly. These permissions are used strictly for importing cookies and are never misused.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@example.com">support@example.com</a>.</p>

    <p>By using the Cookies Store extension, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
